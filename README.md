# LACE-RL (CCGrid'26 Artifact) — Demo

This repository contains the **artifact** for the paper "Green or Fast? Learning to Balance Cold Starts and Idle Carbon in Serverless Computing" accepted at CCGrid 2026.

The artifact provides:
- a **DQN agent ready for inference** (pretrained checkpoint),
- a **trace-driven simulator** implementing the paper’s metrics accounting,
- a **demo script** that runs evaluation and outputs metrics,
- the **demo datasets**

## Quick Start (Demo)

### 1) Environment Setup

Requires **Python 3.10+**.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt # minimal dependencies listed
```

### 2) Run the Demo

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. python scripts/run_demo.py --config configs/demo.json
```
### 3) Output

The demo prints runtime and writes:
+ results/metrics.json

The JSON includes the main metrics defined in the paper (please refer to the paper for more details).

## Notes and Limitations

+ The demo uses a fixed pretrained checkpoint.

+ Artifact evaluation focuses on reproducing behaviors/trends-only.

+ Third-party code/data (if any) are not claimed as our contribution and should be used under their original terms.

+ The demo inputs included in this artifact are a **processed subset** of the data used in our paper, derived from the Huawei Public Cloud trace (Joosen et al., EuroSys 2025) and carbon-intensity time series from Electricity Maps. The full original datasets are not included in this repository; please obtain them from the respective providers and follow their terms of use.
